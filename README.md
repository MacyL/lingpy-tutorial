# LingPy Tutorial

In order to get started, you have two possibilities: If you have jupyter notebooks installed on your machine, just `cd` into this folder and type:

```shell
$ jupyter notebook notebook.ipynb
```

If you do not have jupyter notebooks installed, just double-click on the file `notebook.html`, where you can see the tutorial (but won't be able to run it interactively).
