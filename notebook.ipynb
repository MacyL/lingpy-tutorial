    "# Sequence Comparison with LingPy\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will run you through the major steps needed in order to infer cognates automatically with [LingPy](http://lingpy.org) ([List and Forkel 2016](:ref:List2016e)) from linguistic word list data and to export the data into various formats so that you can either inspect them using tools like the [EDICTOR](http://edictor.digling.org) ([List 2017](:ref:List2017d)), or further analyse them, using software like [SplitsTree](http://splitstree.org) ([Huson 1998](:ref:Huson1998)) or [BEAST](http://www.beast2.org) ([Bouckaert et al. 2014](:ref:Bouckaert2014)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, this tutorial assumes that you have at least an undergraduate level understanding of historical linguistics (particularly the comparative method), requiring only working knowledge of Python and command line operation. Commands will be provided in addition to the pure Python examples in form of a Python script which can be triggered by calling it via the command line and passing certain keywords:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ python3 autocogs.py help\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It is required that you have installed both LingPy in the version [2.5.1](https://github.com/lingpy/lingpy/releases/tag/v2.5.1) for Python3 (as this tutorial will assume that you use Python3) available on [GitHub](https://github.com/lingpy/lingpy), and (as a plus) the [python-igraph](http://igraph.org) package ([Csárdi and Nepusz 2006](:ref:Csardi2006)). Furthermore, in order to follow all examples given in this tutorial, it is useful to work with the [ipython](http://ipython.org) suite, which is very convenient for testing code pieces directly against the Python interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Tiago - I agree that this document should focus on LingPy's usage, but it is essential to give a detailed guide for installing LingPy. Even if the pip version (including cddlutils) is up to date, running `pip install lingpy` is not something so trivial to someone with the expected knowledge of programming/Python/system administration, especially considering the differences between operating systems. Perhaps even a step-by-step instruction or a virtual machine with everything in place could be considered (I used this years ago, when I taught NLTK). I also believe it is important to state the level of Python knowledge that this tutorial assumes, even if it can be followed by most people without a deep understanding of things such as classes, list comprehensions, etc.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial is divided into different blocks, during which different aspects of sequence comparison will be illustrated from the concrete perspective of LingPy. In order to understand fully all that is going on, however, this tutorial won't be sufficient, and it is recommended that those who are interested in the algorithmic and conceptual details of LingPy's major algorithms for sequence comparison have a closer look at the book [Sequence Comparison in Historical Linguistics](https://sequencecomparison.github.io) ([List 2014](:ref:List2014d) in which the most comprehensive state of the art is reflected. More recent papers might occasionally be mentioned in order to account for those aspects of sequence comparison which have been changed since then, but the book on sequence comparison (which is also freely available for download) is still the best starting point.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Hands on the Data: Preparing, Loading, and Testing Word List Data\n",

    "## Hands on the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Testset\n",
    "\n",
    "Linguists are often skeptical when they hear that LingPy requires explicit phonetic transcriptions, and often, they are even reluctant to interpret their data along the lines of the International Phonetic Alphabet. But in order to give the algorithms a fair chance to interpret the data in the same way in which they would be interpreted by linguists, a general practice for phonetic transcriptions is indispensable. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Tiago - maybe a reference to such skepticism could be given here.*\n",
    "\n",
    "For our test, we will use a dataset consisting of 31 Polynesian languages taken from the [ABVD](http://language.psy.auckland.ac.nz/austronesian/) ([Greenhill et al. 2008](:ref:Greenhill2008)). This dataset was intensively revised and cleaned in collaboration with Mary Walworth, who corrected many problematic entries and provided detailed information on how to convert the data into standardized phonetic transcriptions. The testset, along with our basic script containing also this tutorial, is available in the [lingpy](+++) folder of the [QMSS-2017](https://github.com/shh-dlce/qmss-2017) repository. In the following, we will assume that you opened the terminal in this folder so that in case you list all files using the `ls` command, you will see files like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `autocogs.py`\n",
    "* `polynesian.tsv`\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us start by quickly examining the file `polynesian.tsv` which we prepared for this occasion. This file is a tab-separated text file with the first row indicating the header, and the very first column is reserved for numeric identifiers. If you open this file in a spreadsheet editor (and make sure to select \"tab\" as a delimiter, and NO characters to delimit a cell), will see that it is a very straightforward spreadsheet, in which the first row is a header indicating the names of the columns, and the first cell is reserved for an identifier, which should be numeric (but order does not matter).\n",

    "You may even prepare your data in a spreadsheet to then analyze it in LingPy. You just need to make sure to export it properly to the TSV format (which you can easily do by just copy-pasting it into an empty text-file). What you need to know about the format, however, is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. contrary to most linguists' intuition, the columns do **not** indicate languages: each row indicates one word and, as a result, language names need to be redundantly repeated\n",
    "2. certain columns are **required** by LingPy, and their number can vary, depending on the task you want to carry out: for the purpose of cognate detection, you need at least the columns `doculect`, `concept`, and either a plain transcription (the default column name is `ipa`) or a more advanced and less ambiguous transcription in segmented form (the default column name is `tokens`).\n",
    "3. in order to increase readability, column headers are upper-case when LingPy writes them to file, but this is not required (internally all columns are represented as lowercase when loaded into LingPy's objects)\n",
    "4. depending on the names of the columns, values will be interpreted by default: if you have a column called `cogid`, this will be converted to an integer, and `tokens` usually assumes that you have a string separated by spaces. As a result, LingPy may throw an error if your columns do not follow these required formats. To check how columns are interpreted, you can check the file [wordlist.rc](https://github.com/lingpy/lingpy/blob/master/lingpy/data/conf/wordlist.rc) where you will find a full account of currently supported values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all of the columns in the table above are fully \"standardized\". The `DOCULECT` one, for example, so far only requires that distinct languages are given distinct names, no matter what those names contain (as long it has no tabulation stops). But for the purpose of exporting the data to other formats afterward, it is useful to restrict to alphanumeric names here, and to exclude all brackets or spaces from the language names, as we have been doing in this test set. This becomes especially important when inferring trees or using trees in further LingPy analyses: as trees are represented in the [Newick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newick_format) format, where brackets play an important role, brackets in the names for the doculects will confuse the algorithm and raise an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Tiago - Considering that the paragraph below explains where the GLOTTOCODE and CONCEPTICON_ID come from, it might be worth explaining where the DOCULECT ids for this example come from, too.*\n",
    "\n",
    "As the last point, note that we list `GLOTTOCODE` and `CONCEPTICON_ID`, which follows two major requirements for word list data we try to establish for the [Cross-Linguistic Data Formats (CLDF)](http://cldf.clld.org) initiative. As the linguistic sign has three major dimensions, the *language*, the *meaning*, and the *word form*, `GLOTTOCODE`, the language identifier provided by the [Glottolog project](http://glottolog.org) ([Hammarström, Forkel and Haspelmath 2017](:ref:Hammarstroem2017)) and `CONCEPTICON_ID`, the meaning identifier provided by the [Concepticon project](http://concepticon.clld.org) ([List, Cysouw, and Forkel 2016](:ref:List2016a) cover two of these aspects, while the third aspect, the consistency of the form, is currently covered by LingPy (more on this below).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Segmentation of Phonetic Entries\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the \"normal\" requirement of the data to be written in IPA, LingPy offers to provide the explicit segmentation of the data into sound segments. Segmentation is represented as a space-separated string in the input data, as you can see when looking at the table above, right in the cells of the `TOKENS` column. While segmentation looks unspectacular in these cases where each sound is represented by only one symbol, it may become problematic when dealing with affricates, pre-aspirated sounds, and complex vowels. The problem is usually that IPA transcriptions are inherently ambiguous, and this ambiguity is then passed on to the algorithms which cannot handle it. For example, a word like German `[`apfəl`]` \"apple\" could be either segmented as `[` a p f ə l `]`, or, and historically more consistently, as `[` a pf ə l `]`. But if the latter reading is intended (and this is usually language-family-specific), the only way to handle this consistently in IPA would be to put the bar over it: `[`ap͡fəl`]`. This practice, however, would still render the detection of pre-aspiration and other cases impossible. Although LingPy deals rather well with explicit IPA, we recommend all users to segment the data themselves and indicate this by placing one column in their input word list, in which the phonetic entries are explicitly segmented by a space (with the underscore being used to mark original spaces, i.e., word breaks).\n",
    "\n",
    "LingPy's `sequence`-package offers many functions to handle phonetic sequences and to segment them automatically. As an example, consider the following code-pieces and try to find out what they are actually doing (or trigger ```$ python3 autocog.py segments``` in the command line):"

    "You can see from these examples that LingPy's `ipa2tokens` function automatically identifies diacritics and the like, but that you can also tweak it to some extent. If the sequence contains white spaces, as in the first example, `ipa2tokens` will split by white space and assume that the data is *already* segmented. We won't go into the details of this and other functions here, but you should consider giving the documentation a proper read before you start spending time on segmenting your data manually. At the same time, when trusting LingPy's default algorithm for segmentation, you should always make sure after using it that the segmentations make sense. If they are largely wrong or problematic, you should refine them before running any automatic cognate detection method.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative is to use the `segments` package by Steven Moran, whose main idea is more comprehensively described in [Moran and Cysouw (2017)](:ref:Moran2017). We have in fact been using it for our working example in order to segment the ABVD data on Polynesian languages properly, but it would require more time to introduce you to all the details at this point. Just keep in mind that segmentation is **crucial** for automatic cognate detection and that it is your responsibility to make sure that the algorithms \"understand\" the data you give them to analyze.\n",
    "\n",
    "Above, I wrote that LingPy takes care of the *word form* as one of the units of the linguistic sign in the classical \"Saussurean\" model. But how can we know whether LingPy recognizes a symbol or not? For this, we need to understand what LingPy does internally with word forms. Here, LingPy follows [Dolgopolsky's (1964)](:ref:Dolgopolsky1964) idea of \"sound classes\", namely the idea that we can break down the complexity inherent in phonetic transcription to some major classes of sounds so that those sounds represent some kind of a coherent unit. Dolgopolsky was thinking of sounds which often occur in correspondence relation to each other, assuming that there is a certain sound-correspondence probability inherent in all sounds (see also [Brown, Holman, and Wichmann 2013](:ref:Brown2013)). In my experience so far, this is definitely one important aspect, but even more important is the role of reducing variation which is unnecessary for historical comparison while at the same time maintaining a sufficient degree of distinctiveness. For this reason, I expanded Dolgopolsky's original system of only 10 sound classes to as many as 25 sound classes, and LingPy further offers the alphabet which was used for the [ASJP project](http://asjp.org) ([Wichmann, Holman, and Brown 2014](Wichmann2014)), which consists of 40 symbols in a slightly modified version. The following image illustrates the differences between these sound class alphabets and also shows how they represent the Greek word for \"daughter\".\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](soundclasses.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "How can we represent sound classes in LingPy? There is one main function that converts a segmented sound sequence into sound classes. This function `tokens2class` takes as input a list or a tuple of segments, that is, the output which you would also get when calling `ipa2tokens`, and a valid sound class model. You can theoretically create models yourself, and pass them as an instance of a specific `Model` class in LingPy, but for the moment, we will only use the ones which are there and denote them with strings, i.e., `dolgo` for Dolgopolsky's model, `sca` for my expanded model of Dolgopolsky, and `asjp` for the ASJP model). Let's just take these three and another specific model, called `art` (for \"articulation\") which gives numbers to indicate the prosody of sounds, and convert the word Greek `[`θiɣatɛra`]` into the different sound class systems (you can also trigger this by typing ```$ python3 autocogs.py classes``` in the command line).\n"

This zero will be treated as an uninvited guest in most comparisons. It won't be aligned with other elements and will score negatively in the automatic cognate detection routines. You should thus try to avoid this by making sure that your sequences do not contain any errors. When carrying out cognate the detection analysis, we have a specific keyword `check` which you can set to `True` to make sure that all sequences with zeros in sound classes are excluded before the analysis is carried out.

Following an earlier study by [List (2014b)](:ref:List2014c), we know now that at least 100 word pairs for languages as disparate as English and French are needed to provide a solid basis for automatic cognate detection. But when dealing with a large dataset of different languages, which necessarily contains a number of gaps (not all concepts can be elicited in the sources, field work has not provided enough details, etc.), it can be deleterious if the *mutual coverage* between the languages is low. \n",
    "\n",
    "By mutual coverage, I mean the number of comparable word pairs (with the same concept) for each language pair in a given dataset. We can compare different aspects of mutual coverage, such as the *average mutual coverage*, where we average the number of available word pairs, or the *minimal mutual coverage*, which provides the smallest mutual coverage of any pair of languages. In addition, one can also ask for the subset fulfilling a minimal mutual coverage for all language pairs, and this task would return the subset of languages in a `Wordlist` which all have at least the mutual coverage specified by the user. LingPy offers now (in version 2.5.1) solutions for all these problems, but since the last problem is considerably hard and computationally intensive, we won't discuss it here, but will instead simply check the minimal mutual coverage which holds for all languages in our sample. So we try to find the lower bound of concept pairs which all languages have in common (type ```$ python3 autocogs.py coverage1``` in command line)."

    "Phonetic alignment is *per se* independent of the existence of any word list data. Instead, it is a way to align phonetic sequences (words in phonetic transcription) in various ways. Phonetic alignment is an important pre-requisite in order to identify regular sound correspondences. Regular sound correspondences again are important to identify cognates (at least in the classical framework of the comparative method). In addition, alignment analyses are useful in presenting one's analyses in a transparent way, since, unfortunately, scholar often think that their cognate judgments are self-evident, ignoring that a linguist with another language family as their specialty will barely be able to follow the idiosyncratic discourse on language-family-specific sound change patterns and the like. \n",

Instead, I will illustrate how you can make a quick multiple alignment using the `Multiple` class of LingPy. This class is automatically imported when importing LingPy, and it requires a list of sequences as input. Here again, LingPy will automatically try to split your input sequences if they are not already segmentized, but we advise you to segmentize them properly before. Let's just use the six words for \"Eight\" which we tested before, to align the words accordingly. We type them in by pre-segmenting them, following the space-segmented annotation principle, which is used in all sequence representations of LingPy. We start with the simplest method, the *progressive alignment*, which first makes a little tree of the input sequences and then aligns them by going the tree from the leaves to the root, every time aligning two more until all are aligned (```$ python3 autocogs.py alignments1``` in command line):"

You could also base the name in a description of its difference, such as in the pairwise comparisons, permutations, or in the difference between attested and expected frequencies.*\n",

    "3. language-specific sequence similarity partitioning (LSSP), follows the core idea of the LexStat algorithm by which sequence similarity is calculated on a language-specific basis for each language pair in the data, based on permutation statistics which give hints regarding the most likely candidates for regular sound correspondences.\n"

    "We are now ready to do the same analysis with the \"lexstat\" method. This will take some time due to the permutation test. In order to make sure we do not need to run this all the time, we will save the data immediately after running the permutation to a file which we give the extension \"bin.tsv\", and which we can load in case we want to carry out further tests, or which we can otherwise also share when publishing results, as it contains all the data needed to rerun the analyses on a different machine. LingPy creates a lot of data when analyzing wordlists, but by default, only a minimal amount of the data is written to file. In this case, if we want to store the results of the permutation test, we need to store the whole file with all the data that lingpy produces, especially the language-specific scoring function. In order to force LingPy to do so, we have to add the keyword ```ignore=[]``` to the output-function. This will prevent that any data which should be written to file is ignored (```$ python3 autocogs.py cognates-lexstat``` in commandline):"

Here, we do still use the \"lexstat\" approach, but we use \"infomap\" ([Rosvall and Bergstroem 2008](:ref:Rosvall2008)) as our cluster method. This method is network-based rather than agglomerative (as is LingPy's default), and was shown to yield consistently better results in combination with \"lexstat\" ([List, Greenhill, and Gray 2017](:ref:List2017c)). In order to avoid that we override the content of the column \"lexstatid\", we now pass a specific keyword, called `ref` (the \"reference\" of the output) and set its value to \"infomap\". We also choose a different threshold, the one we empirically determined from tests on different language families (see ibd. for details, (```$ python3 autocogs.py cognates-infomap``` in command line):"

    "### Aligning the Results\n",
    "\n",
    "One great advantage of LingPy is that alignments can also be directly computed from automatically inferred cognate sets. This is useful, first also for manually annotated cognate sets, as it saves a lot of work, since alignment algorithms come very close to human judgments, and it requires only minimal post-annotation by humans to correct the errors. Second, it is useful to check the data, as it makes transparent where the algorithm found the similarity that triggered a respective cognate decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "When carrying out alignment analyses, we use the `Alignments` class in LingPy which requires a word list as input as well as the column which contains the cognate sets which shall be aligned. We will use the \"infomap\" analysis for our automatic alignments, since this usually performs better than the other methods. This is done by specifying the keyword `ref` as \"infomap\" when calling the `Alignments` class. As a further important tweak, we first load the data into the `LexStat` class so that we have the inferred sound correspondences which will then be used to compute our alignments. For this purpose, we load the file `mikronesian.bin.tsv` which stores the results of our permutation analysis and provides language-specific scores for all segments in the data (high scores indicating likely sound correspondences, low scores < 0 indicating non-corresponding sounds). We align using the normal progressive alignment, which is usually sufficient for smaller alignments and is slightly faster. When calling the alignment algorithm, we define the specific keyword `scoredict` and pass it the `lex.cscorer`, which stores the language-specific scoring functions for our data (```$ python autocogs.py alignments4``` in command line):"

    "This was not very spectacular, as we have not yet seen what happened. We can visualize the alignments from the command line by picking a particular cognate set and printing the alignments on screen. The alignments are added in a specific column called `alignments` as a default (but which can be modified by specifying another value with the keyword `alignments` passed to the initialization method for the `Alignments` class). Additionally, they can be retrieved using the `Alignments.get_msa` method - since multiple different alignment analyses can be stored in the object, the reference to a particular analysis must be passed. The following code illustrates how we can print a particular aligned cognate set (```python3 autocogs.py alignments5``` in command line):"

    "This is by far not all you can do with LingPy, but it should be almost enough for a first demonstration. Yet in the reminder of this tutorial, I want to show quickly, what you can do, once the data has been analyzed. We will start by showing how to visualize and inspect the data word by word and alignment by alignment, using the [EDICTOR](http://edictor.digling.org) tool, which I have been developing for the last couple of years, and which has now been released in a first beta version ([List 2017](:ref:List2017d)). Then I will show how we can evaluate the accuracy of our findings with help of LingPy's evaluation module. Last but not least, I will show how you can export distance data, `Nexus` files, and trees with help of LingPy's export facilities.\n",

    "The EDICTOR is a web-based tool written entirely in JavaScript which helps to load LingPy's tsv-files and inspect them in various ways. In order to use it, make sure to use FireFox, GoogleChrome, or Safari as your web browser, open the url [http://edictor.digling.org](http://edictor.digling.org), and you will see a welcome screen as follows:\n",

    "In order to inspect your data, all you have to do is to take your file and *drag* it onto the \"browse\" field. Alternatively, you can also click on the browse field and then select the file by navigating to its location. Once this has been done, you will need to apply some tweaks with the EDICTOR which would take to long to be discussed here in text. However, for those who only have the chance to read this tutorial online, consider having a look at the help instructions of the EDICTOR itself, or by checking out the little demo video (of which the music was cut, due to copyright problems, play \"Like a Rolling Stone\" in Dylan's original version, when watching it to get the right feeling).\n",

    "### Evaluation with LingPy\n",
    "\n",
    "LingPy has a couple of evaluation methods implemented, and since we have original expert cognate judgments from ABVD, we can compare our findings against theirs. Comparing cognate set accuracy is not necessarily a trivial problem, as we deal with cluster comparisons, which is a topic that was debated a lot in circles outside of linguistics, and it would lead us too far away if we discussed it in detail here now. For a linguistic viewpoint with a brief working example of our preferred method, the B-Cubed scores (see [Hauer and Kondrak 2011](:ref:Hauer2011), [Bagga and Baldwin 1998](:ref:Bagga1998), and [Amigo et al. 2009](:ref:Amigo2009)), see List, Greenhill, and Gray (2017). What you need to know, however, is that evaluation in NLP circles usually comes along with the concepts of *precision*, *recall*, and *f-score*. Initially, I found them rather difficult to grasp, as historical linguists usually think in terms of false positives and false negatives. In order to understand the idea, one should think that an algorithm for cognate detection can basically do two things either right or wrong: it could cluster words which are not cognate, or it could fail to cluster words as cognate. In the first case, we would measure this in terms of precision, by counting, how often the algorithm proposes correct or incorrect answers, and in the latter case, we measure the proportion of cognate sets which are missed. In the B-Cubed measure we use, this translates roughly to a measure of false/true positives vs. false/true negatives, but it is not entirely the same. The f-score computes the harmonic mean, which summarizes both values, and we usually want to improve the f-score and we use it to compare different algorithms with each other. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start and do this comparison now, by loading the respective functions from the LingPy evaluation module, and computing precision, recall, and f-scores for all our different automatically inferred cognate sets with respect to the gold standard. The gold standard is located in the column `COGID` of the input file, so we need to name this when comparing with any of the other columns (like `LEXSTATID`, etc., ```$ python3 autocogs.py evaluate``` in terminal)."

The distance calculation as a default counts, how many cognates there are for all concepts between each language pair, so in some way, this tries to mimick Swadesh's original idea of distances or similarities between languages (```$ python3 autocog.py distances``` in commandline):"
